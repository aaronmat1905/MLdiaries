# ML-Diaries: Aaron's Hands-on Machine Learning Notes

Hey everyone!

Welcome to Aaron's ML Notes!

This repo is where I keep all my hands-on work. It's a curated collection of practical, code-focused implementations that cover key topics in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). 

I'm constantly learning new things, so I'll be updating this regularly as I go. Feel free to explore, clone the repo, and learn alongside me!
