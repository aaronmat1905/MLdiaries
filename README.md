## Overview

ML-Diaries contains compact, reproducible implementations for learning and teaching fundamental ML/DL techniques. The aim is to provide clear code, runnable examples, and brief explanations so readers can quickly understand and reproduce results.

## Implemented Modules & Status


Status legend:
- Completed — documented examples available (notebooks and/or code present)
- Partial — partial coverage or examples in progress
- Planned — listed for future work

## Getting started

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- Typical ML libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, torch or tensorflow (depending on module)

Quick start:

You can directly download the Notebooks, from github.com [Not too much work--just have to locate it], or if you'd like this way, Here's That:

1. Clone the repository:
   $ git clone <repo-url>
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   $ python -m venv .venv
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies (example):
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Explore notebooks/ and run example scripts.

Actually, I've compiled this work from Personal Notes in Class, **AI-Generated Help**, Different textbooks and sources (Video/Articles on Medium/Substack/YouTube or any other leading platform). So: It's technically a Compilation, use as you wish :)
